# DFA Toolkit

This project describes an NFA class which contains several useful methods for working with NFAs, including a method that determines whether or not an NFA is a DFA, and a method capable of minimizing DFAs using the K-Equivalence Method. The NFA class also includes a toString() method which prints out a visual representation of the states and transitions in a given NFA. 

Users can define alphabets for their own alphabets for their machines and add a large number of custom states and transitions â€” making this project a powerful tool for visualizing and simplifying complex DFAs. Examples of how to create and add states to a DFA can be found in the text file, which is located here: https://github.com/kirakira0/DFAMinimizer/blob/master/src/test/nfa/NFATests.java. 

The image below depicts three examples of a DFA being printed, minimized, and then printed again.
